# Active Context

## Current Focus
Preparing for deployment of the new interactive design.

## Recent Changes
- **Content Update**: Elaborated on the "Pivot to Safety" narrative on the Home page, detailing the transition from hardware to LLM-powered avatars and the resulting safety insights.
- **Interactive Design**: Integrated `framer-motion` to add life and motion to the site.
- **New Components**:
  - `AnimatedBackground`: A subtle, continuously moving background with floating orbs.
  - `FadeIn`: A wrapper for scroll-triggered entrance animations.
- **Page Enhancements**:
  - **Home**: Staggered text reveals, mission section fade-ins, and hover effects on images.
  - **About**: Staggered grid entrance for team cards with interactive hover states.

## Next Steps
1.  Verify responsiveness across devices (basic check done).
2.  Deploy updates to GitHub Pages.

## Active Decisions
- **Design Language**: Shifted from generic corporate light theme to a "Dark Mode" tech-forward aesthetic to align with the product (LemurBox) and the AI Safety mission.
- **Glassmorphism**: Used semi-transparent backgrounds with backdrop blur for containers to create depth.
- **Animation Strategy**: Used `framer-motion` for declarative, performant animations. Prioritized subtle, smooth motion (opacity, transform) over flashy effects to maintain professional credibility.
