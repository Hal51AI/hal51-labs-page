# Active Context

## Current Focus
Refining the visual design to match the "LemurBox" aesthetic.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented a global dark theme with deep violet/blue gradients.
- Redesigned the Navbar with glassmorphism effects.
- Updated Home and About pages with modern typography, gradients, and card styles.
- Enhanced the "LemurBox" image presentation with glow effects.

## Next Steps
1.  Verify responsiveness across devices (basic check done).
2.  Deploy updates to GitHub Pages.

## Active Decisions
- **Design Language**: Shifted from generic corporate light theme to a "Dark Mode" tech-forward aesthetic to align with the product (LemurBox) and the AI Safety mission.
- **Glassmorphism**: Used semi-transparent backgrounds with backdrop blur for containers to create depth.
