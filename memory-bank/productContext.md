# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Hal51 AI needs a platform to articulate its dual focus on Education and AI Safety. The company started with educational hardware (LemurBox) but identified data and AI safety as critical "moats" and necessities for safe educational AI tools.

## Solution
A clean, professional website that tells this story:
1.  **Origin**: Education & LemurBox (DIY holograms).
2.  **Evolution**: The integration of LLMs into 3D avatars for education exposed the gap between AI capability and safety, providing unique, practical insights into AI alignment from real-world classroom deployment.
3.  **Current Mission**: Building safe, aligned AI for education to benefit mankind.

## User Experience Goals
- **Clarity**: Visitors should immediately understand what Hal51 AI does.
- **Credibility**: Highlighting the strong academic and industry background of the founders, supported by a dedicated Research page detailing expertise in adversarial robustness and bias mitigation.
- **Accessibility**: Easy access to their research publications and safety initiatives.
